# AFTrack resource

This is just a try to make it easier to get languages files translated.

res/values/strings.xml is the main files
res/values-de/strings.xml is the German translation (finished)
res/values-it/strings.xml is the Italian translation (finished)
res/values-us/strings.xml is the German translation (only partly)

With git start to clone this files

<pre>
git clone 
</pre>

To add a language to this system please add a folder
e.g res/values-fr and copy the default string.xml (folder 'values') into this new folder
